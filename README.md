# fitparser

This is a project consisting of several sub-modules:

|Directory|Description|
|:--------|:----------|
**fit2csv**|Converts FIT files to CSV, exporting session, lap and records information in separate files
**fit2json**|Dumps a FIT file to JSON. This is mostly meant for debugging and digging out information for use in *fit2csv*
**gpx2csv**|Converts GPX files to CSV, exporting metadata, tracks and segments, routes, and waypoints into separate files.
**tcx2csv**|Converts TCX files to CSV, exporting activities summaries and laps into separate files.

More files may come in the future. :smile:

See the [Kanban Boards](https://github.com/evensolberg/fit2csv/projects) for the overall roadmap and To Do lists.
