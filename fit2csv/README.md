# fit2csv

A simple little utility to decode FIT files and output them in various formats.

- The session information will be output to a JSON file
- The lap information will be output to a CSV file
- The individual records will be output to a CSV file

Eventually, each level will have the information from the previous level.
My end goal is for this utility to be a one-stop shop for all things FIT analysis.
